# Exploring the Impact of Reflexivity Theory and Cognitive Social Structures on the Dynamics of Doctor-Patient Social System

## Description

This project investigates the impact of reflexivity theory and cognitive social structures on the dynamics of a doctor-patient social system. Two different models are explored: a classical behavioral model and a cognitive social system model. Both models utilize a microbial genetic algorithm to optimize the behavior of doctor and patient agents. The study aims to understand how different social and cognitive influences affect the interactions and outcomes in a healthcare network.
