# Exploring the Impact of Reflexivity Theory and Cognitive Social Structures on the Dynamics of Doctor-Patient Social System

## Description

This project investigates the impact of reflexivity theory and cognitive social structures on the dynamics of a doctor-patient social system. Two different models are explored: a classical behavioral model and a cognitive social system model. Both models utilize a microbial genetic algorithm to optimize the behavior of doctor and patient agents. The study aims to understand how different social and cognitive influences affect the interactions and outcomes in a healthcare network.

## Installation

To run this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x

To use this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd your-repo-name
```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebooks:
```bash

## Project Structure
- classical_behavioral_model_GA_final_vals.ipynb: Contains the implementation and simulation of the classical behavioral model using a microbial genetic algorithm.
- cog_sys_GA_final_vals.ipynb: Contains the implementation and simulation of the cognitive social system model using a microbial genetic algorithm.
- cognitive_social_system_model_GA_social_net.ipynb: Contains additional simulations and social network analysis for the cognitive social system model.

## Features
### Classical Behavioral Model
- Doctor and Patient Agents: Simulates interactions between doctors and patients, where doctors provide treatments and patients rate the doctors based on treatment effectiveness.
- Microbial Genetic Algorithm: Optimizes the attributes and behaviors of doctor and patient agents through evolutionary processes.
### Cognitive Social System Model
- Extended Attributes: Incorporates social ties and cognitive influences into the agent behaviors.
- Social Network Analysis: Analyzes how social structures and reflexivity impact the interactions and outcomes within the healthcare network.
- Microbial Genetic Algorithm: Continues to optimize agent behaviors considering social and cognitive factors.
  
## Results
The project compares the outcomes of the classical behavioral model and the cognitive social system model, highlighting the differences in agent behaviors and system dynamics under different theoretical frameworks.
